The pre-built binary requires Java 11.

# Building

It's built using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2, so it's safe to say that you should use that or above.

# Releases

Currently, I am only creating this with Java. A C# version may come soon.

# Credits

Some StackOverflow articles came in handy during the making of this project. Thanks to the people who answered those questions on that website!
